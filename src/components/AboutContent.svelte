    Extensive research underscores the health implications of extended periods
    of inactivity, linking them to significant concerns for spinal health,
    including back and neck pain, as well as broader issues like cardiovascular
    disease and decreased metabolic health. The <strong>SitStandTimer</strong> is
    rooted in these findings, aiming to disrupt sedentary patterns by integrating
    movement into your daily routine.
